    <descr>This is the main goblin camp. Several tiny passages that are too small
    too crawl through line the walls and floors. They must lead to even bigger
    goblin outposts. There is a big chest standing in the corner.

        It's a solid goblin war chest. Scribbled with what appears to be blood,
        it says 'Propetie of Haagh'
